        "Discuss string slicing and provide examples? String slicing in Python allows you to extract parts of a string by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step. The general syntax for slicing is:\n",

        "\n",
        "start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
        "end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
